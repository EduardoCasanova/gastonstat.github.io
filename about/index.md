# About Me

I'm an applied statistician who loves to analyze data, visualize it
and develop computational tools for doing so.

## Currently

I'm a research engineer in the <em>Unit of Sensometrics and Chemometrics</em> at Oniris-Nantes.


## Research

Doing R&D in statistical programming, and working on multiblock methods for 
multivariate data analysis.


## Interests

There are 3 major topics that I'm hooked to:
 
- I really like [working](/work) with analytical tools 
and methods, especially those designed for very practical applications.
- I'm fascinated with the use of graphical displays to understand data with 
visualization.
- I'm a passionate R user as well as a 
[developer](/software) of statistical software in R.


## Blog

Occasionally, I like to talk about data analysis, visualization, statistics, R and 
related stuff in my blog [Data Analysis Visually EnfoRced](/blog).

Besides data visualization, I also like to visualize the world through the lens of my camera

## Trifecta

What I like about my "job" is that:

1. It can be applied to practically all sciences and disciplines;
2. Consequently, it has allowed me to open the doors of many different fields;
3. But most important, it has given me the fortune to work with very smart and talented 
people from all over the world (from whom I've learned so much).


## Contact

The easiest way to get in touch with me is by email. Feel free to drop me a line with 
feedback, report bugs, suggest ideas, ask me questions about my work, or just say hi.

```gaston.stat at gmail.com```

I can quickly reply to **short** messages but if my answer is going to take me more than 1 
minute I may not reply immediately (so be patient). 

If you have something else in mind please consider the following options 
(I'll be happy to discuss any details):

- Reviewer
- Invited Speaker
- Consulting

# About this website

This website is my personal space where I try to declutter my ideas and put my 
projects in order. This is easier said than done.
  
- It only happens after many iterations and refinements
- During days and nights in front of a computer
- Fueled by dozens of cups of coffee and tea
- Sometimes listening to music, sometimes in silence
